CookBook takes a very flexible approach to content definition, there are no predefined structures for pages, blog posts etc. You are free to define content model by your needs. Content data structure and rules in CookBook are defined with entity types and attributes, each entity type represents one resource (projects, pages, articles, books, clients). Resource structure and data bits are described with sets of attributes. Attributes represent fields ( or columns in relational database context) with name, data type, and other metadata like validation for example.
